# Heat Map - D3.js

## Description
Creating a program that takes a large dataset and displays it as a Heat Map using D3.js

### The bar chart should look similar to this:

### I used these languages to create this project
```html
<div>
  <p>HTML</p>
  <p>CSS</p>
  <p>JavaScript</p>
  <p>D3.js</p>
</div>
```

> I used the D3 svg-based visualization library to visualize the data

### What was the aim?
* Using a large dataset consisting of over 1000 data entries and visualizing it in the form of a Heat Map using D3.js
* The Heat Map had to have a list of functions.
* One of the functions was that if the dataset is altered or modified, then the Heat Map would render that modification (if it is still in a dataset format).
* The other function was that when hovering over areas on the Heat Map, it will display a tooltip providing a description (a short one) of the hovered area. The description should be linked to the dataset's ID.
* Another aim of this project was to produce axes for the Heat Map.
